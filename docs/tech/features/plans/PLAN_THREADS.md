# PLAN_THREADS

Status: Completed
Date: 2025-09-15

Docs: docs/tech/features/FEATURES_THREADS.md
Modules: src/threads/{mod.rs, utils.rs, macros.rs}
Tests: tests/threads/sanity.rs; UAT tests/uat/threads.rs

Gaps/Findings
- Macros previously referenced visual logging (`info!`); ensure core-only logging via utils.

Plan
- Confirm no visual coupling remains. Extend UAT with timeout wait path. (OK)

Acceptance
- Sanity + UAT green; macros compile without visual feature.

Result
- Ran `threads_sanity` and `uat_threads` â€” both passed.
