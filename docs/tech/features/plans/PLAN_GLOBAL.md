# PLAN_GLOBAL

Status: Completed
Date: 2025-09-15

Docs: docs/tech/features/FEATURES_GLOBAL.md
Modules: src/global/{mod.rs, registry.rs, helpers.rs?}
Tests: tests/features/global/core.rs; sanity_main covers global; adapters and host_* tests exercise integration.

Gaps/Findings
- Strong presence. Ensure export/import behaviors documented; confirm token stream detection tests comprehensive.

Plan
- Review registry semantics and namespacing helpers; ensure error surfaces documented. (OK)
- Add a compact UAT showing env + config hydration + export. (Already present as `uat_global`)

Acceptance
- Sanity + UAT pass; docs aligned with actual key behavior and precedence (env vs config).

Result
- Ran `features_global`, `global_core`, `adapter_global`, `adapter_global_light` â€” all passed.
