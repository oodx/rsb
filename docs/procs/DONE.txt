self-hydrating workflow system that transforms agent onboarding from
30+ minutes to 5 minutes with zero context reconstruction.

## Ready for Future:
This completed milestone establishes RSB as a model for self-hydrating workflow
systems and provides the foundation for Milestone M1 (OsString Integration)
and beyond. The project is now positioned for sustained velocity and
systematic execution excellence.

## Next Phase:
