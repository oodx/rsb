Previously missing features detected during test run and now addressed:

- Macro `str_line!`: added in src/macros/text.rs
- Macro `sleep!`: added in src/macros/time_math.rs
- Macro `rand_range!`: added in src/macros/json_dict_random.rs (uses random::rand_range_usize)
- Macros `path_canon!` and `path_split!`: added in src/macros/fs_data.rs (wrap fs::path_canon/path_split)
- Macro `meta_keys!`: added in src/macros/fs_data.rs (uses fs::parse_meta_keys)
- Zip archive macros:
  - `zip!(extract: ...)`, `zip!(extract: ..., to: ...)`, and `zip!(list: ...)` added in src/macros/fs_data.rs

Notes:
- The example `archive-test` still depends on external `zip`/`unzip` tools; behavior is skipped at runtime if `zip` is unavailable.
- If any additional gaps are discovered, append them here with a path and brief description.
