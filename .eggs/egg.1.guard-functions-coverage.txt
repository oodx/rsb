🐔 CHINA'S GUARD FUNCTIONS COVERAGE EGG 🥚
================================================================================

📅 DATE: 2025-09-30
🔍 SCOPE: RSB Codebase Guard Functions Analysis

🏆 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
-------------------
Total Guard Functions Found: 35
Total Guard Functions in Prelude: 24
Status: Partial Coverage (68.6% coverage)

🔬 DETAILED FINDINGS:
--------------------
MISSING GUARD FUNCTIONS:
1. CLI Args Module:
   - has_pop(&mut self, flag: &str) -> bool
   - has_val(&mut self, flag: &str) -> Option<String>

2. Progress Module:
   - is_finished(&self) -> bool
   - is_enabled(&self) -> bool
   - has_failures(&self) -> bool

3. TOML Module:
   - is_enabled() -> bool

NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS:
- Most guard functions are well-covered in the prelude
- Missing functions appear to be mostly method-based or context-specific
- Some functions are feature-gated (color and TOML guards), which is appropriate
