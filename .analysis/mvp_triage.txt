 üéØ RSB PROJECT MVP TRIAGE ANALYSIS - PRIORITY SEPARATION & SCOPE DECISIONS
================================================================================

üêî Triaged by: China the Summary Chicken (Strategic Analysis)
üìÖ Date: 2025-09-20
üéØ Purpose: Separate MVP-Critical from Nice-to-Have for Meta Process v2
‚ö° Methodology: Epic 4 Progressive Enhancement Strategy

================================================================================
 üö® MVP CRITICAL - CANNOT SHIP WITHOUT (28 STORY POINTS)
================================================================================

### üî• **TIER 1: FUNDAMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE (13 STORY POINTS)**
**RATIONALE**: Without these, Meta Process v2 literally cannot function

#### **MP1: Core Meta Process Structure (8 story points)** üö® BLOCKER
**WHY MVP**: No self-hydrating workflow possible without entry point and workflow docs
**IMPACT**: 100% of Meta Process v2 functionality depends on this
**RISK**: Project complete failure without implementation

**MVP SCOPE**:
- ‚úÖ START.txt (5-minute onboarding entry point) - ESSENTIAL
- ‚úÖ docs/procs/PROCESS.txt (master workflow guide) - ESSENTIAL
- ‚úÖ docs/procs/QUICK_REF.txt (30-second ultra-fast context) - ESSENTIAL
- ‚úÖ docs/procs/CONTINUE.md (session handoffs) - ESSENTIAL
- ‚ùì docs/procs/SPRINT.txt (current tasks) - COULD DEFER
- ‚ùì docs/procs/ROADMAP.txt (strategic overview) - COULD DEFER

**MVP REDUCTION OPPORTUNITY**: Focus on START.txt + PROCESS.txt + QUICK_REF.txt first
**REDUCED SCOPE**: 5 story points (60% reduction possible)

#### **MP2: Documentation Validation Infrastructure (5 story points)** üö® BLOCKER
**WHY MVP**: Documentation integrity impossible without automated validation
**IMPACT**: System degrades immediately without validation
**RISK**: Documentation rot makes system unusable quickly

**MVP SCOPE**:
- ‚úÖ bin/validate-docs.sh basic structure validation - ESSENTIAL
- ‚úÖ Required file existence checking - ESSENTIAL
- ‚úÖ Silent success, noisy failure pattern - ESSENTIAL
- ‚ùì Advanced reference integrity checking - NICE-TO-HAVE
- ‚ùì Intelligent staleness detection - NICE-TO-HAVE

**MVP REDUCTION OPPORTUNITY**: Focus on structure validation only
**REDUCED SCOPE**: 3 story points (40% reduction possible)

---

### üî• **TIER 2: HISTORICAL DEBT PROCESSING (15 STORY POINTS)**
**RATIONALE**: Cannot implement v2 with scattered unprocessed context

#### **MP3: Historical Documentation Processing (12 story points)** üö® BLOCKER
**WHY MVP**: Valuable insights remain buried and inaccessible
**IMPACT**: Agents lack critical context for productive work
**RISK**: Wisdom loss and context reconstruction overhead

**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**:
- ‚úÖ Current .analysis/.eggs/ (7 files) - PROCESSED by consolidation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è docs/misc/archive/archive/eggs/ (35 files) - GOLD MINE unprocessed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è .session/ files (8 files) - Current development context

**MVP PRIORITIZATION**:
- üî• **HIGH VALUE EGGS** (6 points): Strategic insights, architectural wisdom
  - egg.strategic-rsb-modernization.txt - CRITICAL methodology
  - egg.4.rsb-project-state-comprehensive-analysis.txt - CRITICAL context
  - golden_egg.documentation_cleanup_plan.txt - CRITICAL methodology
  - egg.1.rsb-framework-comprehensive-analysis.txt - CRITICAL architecture
- üü° **MEDIUM VALUE EGGS** (4 points): Feature analysis, test strategies
  - Test-focused eggs (6 files) - Useful but not blocking
  - API validation red_eggs (12 files) - Good insights but Epic 4 complete
- üü¢ **SESSION PROCESSING** (2 points): Extract current state
  - .session/ files for current project state documentation

**MVP REDUCTION STRATEGY**: Process HIGH VALUE eggs first
**REDUCED SCOPE**: 8 story points (33% reduction possible)

#### **MP4: Root Directory Compliance (3 story points)** üü° DEFER CANDIDATE
**WHY MVP**: Structure violations reduce clarity but don't block functionality
**IMPACT**: Organizational improvement, not functional requirement
**RISK**: LOW - Current structure functional, just not ideal

**MVP DECISION**: DEFER to Phase 2 (Enhancement)
**RATIONALE**: Doesn't block core self-hydrating workflow functionality

---

### üìä **MVP CRITICAL REDUCED SCOPE: 16 STORY POINTS** (43% reduction!)
```
TIER 1 REDUCED (8 points):
- MP1 Core Structure (5 points) - Focus on START.txt + PROCESS.txt + QUICK_REF.txt
- MP2 Basic Validation (3 points) - Structure validation only

TIER 2 REDUCED (8 points):

DEFERRED TO PHASE 2 (12 points):
- MP4 Root Directory Cleanup (3 points)
- MP3 Remaining Eggs (4 points)
- MP2 Advanced Validation (5 points)
```

================================================================================
