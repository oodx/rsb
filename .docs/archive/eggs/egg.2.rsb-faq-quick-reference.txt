üêî CHINA'S RSB FAQ & QUICK REFERENCE EGG #2 ü•ö
================================================================================

üìã EGG METADATA
===============
Date Created: 2025-09-15 13:25 UTC
Created By: China the Summary Chicken üêî
Purpose: FAQ-style quick reference for RSB Framework
Based On: Comprehensive analysis of RSB v0.2.19

üîç WHAT IS RSB AND WHY DOES IT EXIST?
=====================================

**Q: What exactly is RSB?**
A: RSB (Rebel String-Based) Rust is a framework that makes Rust feel like writing enhanced bash scripts. It's the official implementation of the REBEL philosophy: "Rust Equalized Beyond Esoteric Lingo."

**Q: Why was RSB created?**
A: To fill the "too big for bash, too small for ceremonial Rust" gap. Think automation scripts, CLI tools, and data processing that need more power than shell scripting but don't require PhD-level Rust expertise.

**Q: What does "REBEL philosophy" mean?**
A:
‚Ä¢ **Accessibility Over Purity**: Bash-like patterns instead of academic Rust idioms
‚Ä¢ **Pragmatic Safety**: Runtime validation vs compile-time type gymnastics
‚Ä¢ **Fail Fast, Fail Clear**: Helpful error messages vs nested Result types
‚Ä¢ **String-First Design**: Strings as universal interface (Unix philosophy)

üÜö HOW DOES RSB DIFFER FROM STANDARD RUST?
==========================================

**Q: What's the main difference in coding style?**
A: Compare these approaches:

Standard Rust (type-heavy):
```rust
let file = std::fs::File::open("log.txt")?;
let reader = std::io::BufReader::new(file);
let lines: Result<Vec<String>, _> = reader.lines().collect();
// ... more type gymnastics
```

RSB (string-first):
```rust
let errors = cat!("log.txt").grep("ERROR").sort().uniq().to_string();
```

**Q: Does RSB sacrifice Rust's safety?**
A: No! It trades *compile-time* type checking for *runtime* validation. You get memory safety and performance, but with easier debugging and bash-like familiarity.

**Q: Can I mix RSB with standard Rust?**
A: Absolutely! RSB is designed as a stepping stone. Start with RSB patterns and gradually integrate standard Rust as your expertise grows.

üîß WHAT ARE THE KEY FEATURES AND MODULES?
========================================

**Q: What's included in RSB?**
A: 13+ major modules, all following the MODERN spec:

Core Framework:
‚Ä¢ **CLI**: Args parsing, bootstrap, dispatch system
‚Ä¢ **GLOBAL**: Configuration management and variable store

**Q: How do I get started?**
A:
1. Add RSB to Cargo.toml: `rsb = { path = "..." }`
2. Import prelude: `use rsb::prelude::*;`
3. Start with basic patterns:
```rust
fn main() {
    let args = bootstrap!();
    dispatch!(&args, {
        "hello" => say_hello,
        "process" => process_files
    });
}
```

**Q: What features should I enable?**
A: Start minimal, add as needed:
- **Default**: Core functionality only
- **Add `colors`**: For terminal output
- **Add `progress`**: For long-running tasks

- **docs/tech/reference/REBEL.md**: Philosophy deep-dive

üî¨ ADVANCED USAGE QUESTIONS
===========================

**Q: Can I use RSB for complex data processing?**
A: Yes! Stream processing is powerful:
```rust
let processed = cat!("huge-dataset.csv")
    .grep(",ACTIVE,")
    .cut(3, ",")
    .sort()
    .uniq()
    .head(1000)
    .to_file("top-active.txt");
```

**Q: How does error handling work?**
A: RSB uses "fail fast, fail clear" approach:
```rust
validate!(!input.is_empty(), "Input file required");
require_file!("config.conf");  // Exits with helpful message if missing
```

**Q: Can I build complex CLI tools?**
A: Absolutely! RSB provides full CLI framework:
- Argument parsing with `Args`
- Command dispatch system
- Option handling
- Help generation
- Bootstrap lifecycle

**Q: What about mathematical operations?**
A: RSB's math module is incredibly powerful:
```rust
// Complex expressions with variables
math!("result = (base ** exponent) * multiplier + offset");

// Statistical analysis
let avg = avg!(&dataset);
let median = median!(&dataset);

// Random data generation
let test_data = random_list!(100, "float", "0.0:1.0");
```

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
===========================

**Q: What about licensing?**
A: Multi-license model:
- **AGPL-3.0**: Open-source projects (must release source)
- **Community Edition**: Personal/educational use only
- **Commercial**: Closed-source/SaaS products (requires agreement)

**Q: Is the API stable?**
A: v0.2.19 indicates pre-1.0, so API changes possible. However, the framework shows mature patterns and comprehensive testing suggests stability for core features.

**Q: What if I encounter bugs?**
A: RSB has "pro-active maturation" - projects should maintain `.rsb-defects` file listing known issues. This shows mature approach to real-world deployment.
