# Sprint Tracker

## 2025-09-12

- RSB documentation sync: added `bin/feat.py` inventory helper and refreshed GLOBAL, STRINGS, CLI feature docs with latest macro/function coverage.
- Extended `feat.py` with `--update-doc` to refresh per-file API listings inside HTML sentinel blocks (GLOBAL/STRINGS/CLI now auto-updatable).
- Ran full sweep across remaining feature docs using `feat.py --update-doc`, added README_FEATS, and reconciled surfaces for bash/colors/date/dev/fs/generators/host/math/options/params/parse/progress/prompts/testing/threads/tokens/truth/visuals.
- Next: run the surface inventory + doc sweep across remaining feature areas and capture follow-up items in their respective PLAN docs.
