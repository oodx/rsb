# _todo: Archived dev_* modules

These modules were development stubs and have been archived from `src/dev_*` to `_todo` to keep the codebase tidy per MODULE_SPEC. They were not referenced by the library and contained planning scaffolding or placeholders.

Archived modules (previous paths under `src/`):
- dev_global/
- dev_gx/
- dev_logic/
- dev_math/
- dev_threads/
- dev_token/

If you need any content restored to an active module, let us know which parts to reâ€‘enable and their new home (e.g., `hosts`, `threads`, `bash`, `cli`).
