//! External dependencies re-exported for consumers of `rsb`.
//!
//! This module exposes commonly used thirdâ€‘party crates so downstream
//! projects can depend on `rsb` alone and import these dependencies
//! from a single place without repeating them in their own `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! Example:
//! ```rust
//! use rsb::deps::rand::{Rng, distr::Alphanumeric};
//! use rsb::deps::lazy_static::lazy_static;
//! ```

// Re-export selected external crates used internally by rsb
